# Project Overview: A/B Testing Email Campaign for Football Forecasting Subscription

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the effectiveness of two different email campaigns promoting a football results forecasting subscription. Using A/B testing, we aim to determine which email drives higher engagement and conversions, helping us optimize future marketing efforts. 

## Dataset & Storage
The dataset is stored in an SQLite database (Email_campaign.db) in a table named email_ab_test_data. It contains the following key metrics:
Sent: Number of emails sent   
Bounced: Number of undelivered emails  
Opened: Number of recipients who opened the email  
Sales: Number of users who subscribed after opening the email  

A/B Test Setup
We designed two email variations (A & B) targeting sports fans and bettors:

Email A: Focuses on expert insights, match predictions, and betting strategies.  
Email B: Highlights AI-powered accuracy and financial benefits of smart betting.  
Both emails were sent to different random groups of recipients.

Email A – “Win More Bets with Expert Football Predictions!”  
Subject: Get Ahead of the Game!
