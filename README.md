# Project Overview: A/B Testing Email Campaign for Football Forecasting Subscription

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the effectiveness of two different email campaigns promoting a football results forecasting subscription. Using A/B testing, we aim to determine which email drives higher engagement and conversions, helping us optimize future marketing efforts. 

## Dataset & Storage
The dataset is stored in an SQLite database (Email_campaign.db) in a table named email_ab_test_data. It contains the following key metrics:
Sent: Number of emails sent   
Bounced: Number of undelivered emails  
Opened: Number of recipients who opened the email  
Sales: Number of users who subscribed after opening the email  

A/B Test Setup
We designed two email variations (A & B) targeting sports fans and bettors:

Key A/B Testing Differences:  
•	Email A: Focuses on expert insights and informed predictions for smart betting.  
•	Email B: Highlights AI-powered accuracy and the financial benefits of subscribing.  
•	Subject Lines: One is about winning more bets, while the other hints at an exclusive edge.    
Both emails were sent to different random groups of recipients.

I used Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze the results of an A/B test. You can find the code and details in the attached **[pdf](https://github.com/DimKaisaris/-A-B-Testing-Email-Campaign-/blob/main/A%2CB%20final%20-%20Jupyter%20Notebook.pdf)**
